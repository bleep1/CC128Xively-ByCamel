# CC128Xively-ByCamel
Current Cost 128 to Xively using Apache Camel on a Odroid ARM board

So I've heard this Apache Camel thing is powerful and easy to use, and my old Arduino-cc128 rig is getting dusty and old. So I layed down a new challenge: Can I re-develop the CC128 to Xively interface using Apache Camel.  Even more, can I do this without writing a single line of java code even though Camel is an integration library using java.
